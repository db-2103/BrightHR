# BrightHR
1) **_"Playwrigth.config.js"_** which has all configuration detials like Timeout, Browsers and reporting etc.
2) **_"BrightHRTEchTask.spec.js"_** which has actual code for mentioned testcases(you will find this file under tests folder).
3) Jenkins pipeline also created but coudn't share it as it's created on my local server. So I can show it when I will come for the interview.
