# BrightHR
I have created two files, _Playwrigth.config.js_ which has all configuration detials like Timeout, Browsers and reporting etc. and _BrightHRTEchTask.spec.js_ which has my actual code for mentioned testcases.
I have also created Jenkins pipeline but coudn't share it as it's created on my local server. So I can show it when I will come for the interview.
